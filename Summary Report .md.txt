 Summary Report: MySQL to PostgreSQL Data Migration

1. Project Overview

The goal of this project was to perform a data migration from MySQL to PostgreSQL for a sample database. This migration ensures that the data is transferred successfully and maintains its integrity throughout the process.

 2. Migration Objective

- Migrate data from a MySQL database (`sample_db`) to a PostgreSQL database (`sample_db_pg`).
- Ensure data integrity is maintained during the migration, including structure, data types, and relationships.
- Provide a detailed summary of the process and highlight any challenges faced.

 3. Steps Performed

Step 1: **Exporting MySQL Database**
- The data in the `sample_db` MySQL database was exported using the `mysqldump` command. This exports the schema (table structure) and the data (records) into a SQL file:
  ```bash
  mysqldump -u root -p sample_db > sample_db.sql
  ```

 Step 2: Modifying the SQL File for PostgreSQL Compatibility
- The SQL file exported from MySQL was not directly compatible with PostgreSQL. We needed to modify the following:
  - **Data types**: MySQL's `AUTO_INCREMENT` was changed to PostgreSQLâ€™s `SERIAL`.
  - **Table creation scripts**: Minor syntax changes were made to match PostgreSQL standards.
  
  Example:
  sql
    MySQL
  CREATE TABLE users (
      id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
      name VARCHAR(100),
      email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
  );

   PostgreSQL (modified)
  CREATE TABLE users (
      id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      name VARCHAR(100),
      email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
  );
  

 Step 3: Creating the PostgreSQL Database
- A new PostgreSQL database was created:
 sql
  CREATE DATABASE sample_db_pg;
 

 Step 4: Importing the Modified SQL File into PostgreSQL
- The modified SQL file was imported into PostgreSQL using the `psql` command:
 
  psql -U postgres -d sample_db_pg -f sample_db_modified.sql


 Step 5: Verifying Data Integrity
- After the import, data integrity was verified by:
  - Comparing row counts between MySQL and PostgreSQL.
  - Checking for any missing or incorrect data.
  
  Example query to check data in PostgreSQL:
 
  SELECT * FROM users;
 

- Sample data in PostgreSQL:
 
   id |  name   |        email        
  ----+---------+---------------------
    1 | Alice   | alice@example.com
    2 | Bob     | bob@example.com
    3 | Charlie | charlie@example.com
 

 5. Tools Used

- MySQL 8.0: For the source database.
- PostgreSQL 14: For the target database.

  6. **Results**


- The data was migrated successfully, with no records lost or corrupted during the transfer.
- The integrity of the data was maintained, and all fields matched correctly between MySQL and PostgreSQL.

7. Conclusion

The migration was completed successfully with full data integrity maintained. The MySQL database was accurately migrated to PostgreSQL, and all data and relationships were preserved. The migration scripts were tested thoroughly and verified to be compatible with PostgreSQL.

 8. Future Recommendations

- Automate the Migration: For larger databases, consider automating the conversion of data types and structures to ensure smoother transitions in the future.
- Data Validation: Always run validation queries post-migration to ensure that all the data was imported correctly and that no records were corrupted.
- Backup: Ensure that a backup of both MySQL and PostgreSQL databases is created before performing any migration to safeguard against data loss.
